Network Setup and Security
The owner of XYZ Travel Agency has been reading the news lately of various cybersecurity incidents around the country. His agency currently has dozens of staff connected to a workgroup with no central file share, no monitoring and no user management. Since he has become concerned about cybersecurity, he has asked us to harden the network and monitor it for security. 

In this project I cover a few different topics including:
Creating a new network with firewalls, servers and clients.
Implementation of a redundant Opnsense firewall with backup features. 
Implementation of Active Directory to help manage users and to create a place to share data/information. 
Harden the network and user accounts for security.
